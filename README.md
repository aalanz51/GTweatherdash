# GTweatherdash

This week we were prompted to utilize a weather APi to create a weather dashboard.

We needed to make the API call and then properly translate it the page in tandem with our HTML and CSS files.

I incorporated openweather, axios, and bootstrap.

As far as initialization goes, when a city is searched, the 5 day forecast should be displayed on the page. The local storage will keep the previous searches on the right until the user clears the search history.
