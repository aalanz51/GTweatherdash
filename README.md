# GTweatherdash

This week we were prompted to utilize a weather APi to create a weather dashboard

I incorporated openweather.com, axios, and bootstrap.

We needed to make the API call and then properly translate it the page in tandem with our HTML and CSS files.

As far as initialization goes, when a city is searched, the 5 day forecast should be displayed on the page. The local storage will keep the previous searches on the right until the user clears the search history.
